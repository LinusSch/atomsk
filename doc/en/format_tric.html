<h2>Format: TRIC</h2>

<p><strong>Name:</strong> (Partial) input file for TRIC, Transmission of Ions through Crystals</p>

<p><strong>Extension:</strong> <code>.TRC</code> (the file must be named <code>INP.TRC</code> for use with TRIC)</p>

<p><strong>Specification:</strong> not available, as far as I'm aware</p>

<p><strong>Visualization programs:</strong> none</p>



<h4>Restrictions</h4>

<p> Output only, Atomsk cannot read this format.
</p>

<p> Currently writes zeros as placeholders for amplitudes of thermal vibrations.
	This is not good, as TRIC WILL HANG with no error message when run with such input.
</p>

<p> Orthogonal cells only, TRIC supports nothing else.
	This can be achieved with the Atomsk option <code>-orthogonal-cell</code>.
</p>

<p> There is no automatic re-sorting of the list of atoms.
	This can be significant as one would typically want an atom at position [000] to use as reference
	for positioning the surface, and therefore wants to know its place in the list.
	Sorting can be achieved with the Atomsk option <code>-sort</code>, see example below.
</p>


<p> Fairly untested, and the format is only defined by what the TRIC code will accept as input,
	so bugs are expected. Report them to Linus Schönström at physics.uu.se, by email (substitute o for ö
	in the email address).
</p>



<h4>Examples</h4>

<ul>
<li><code class="command">atomsk my_system.xsf tric</code>
<p>This will read the file <code>my_system.xsf</code>, and convert it to the file <code>my_system.TRC</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
	<code class="command">atomsk my_system.cif -sort z up -sort y up -sort x up sorted.trc</code>
	<p> This will read the file <code>my_system.cif</code>, sort the atom list so that those with the lowest-valued 
		coordinates appear at the top, and write it to the file <code>sorted.TRC</code>.
	</p>
	<p> Note: in one test this did not quite produce the desired result, y positions appeared to have been sorted
		before z positions, although x positions appeared correctly sorted last.
	</p>
</li>
</ul>
